## FAQs
***
A list of frequently asked questions
1. **Can assistants created with September do what Siri does?**
Not exactly, these assistants have less functionality and chat-ability than siri. but september, unlike siri, allows everyone to have a different assistant according to the answers they give, instead of having 1 assistant for everyone.
2. **Why do I keep getting a pyaudio error**
because PyAudio has one of the worst download systems ever created. To solve the problem, you need to download and install the whell file from [this](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio) link
3. **Why is it slow?**
Basitçe anlatmak gerekirse her programı başlattığınızda programın kendisini yeniden eğitmesinden dolayı başlama aşaması normalden yavaş gerçekleşiyor. Fakat kullanırken gösterdiği yavaşlık tamamen sizinsisteminizle alakalı.
